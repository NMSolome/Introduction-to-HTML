<!-- // Javascript is a list of statements. These statements are instructions to be executed by a computer. -->

<!-- // statements are composed of 
values ( x, y, z ), 
Operators (= + - * /), 
Expressions ( combination of values, varibles, operators which computes a value), 
Keywords (var, let, const, if, switch, for, function, return, try)
comments (   /*, //, */ )

The staments are executed one by one in the same order they are written

semi colon (;) separate the executable statements
let a, b, c; a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
Good practice to put spaces around (a=5) & (a = 5)

In case line is long, breaks only happen at after the operator

Code blocks (many executable statements) can be run using within {     }

var - Declares a variable
let	- Declares a block variable
const - Declares a block constant
if - Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch - Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for - Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function - Declares a function
return - Exits a function
try - Implements error handling to a block of statements -->

<!-- SYNTAX
set of rules
Create variables with var, let and const.
Use variables using operators (= + - * /)

Javascript values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Rules for fixed values. 
numbers are written with or without decimals ( 100 and/or 5.6)
Strings written in "  " or '  '

Variable values are called Variables.
These are used to store data values
key word used (var, let, const.)
= used to assign values to variables.

Operators : compute values

Expressions: 5 * 10 = 50 or x * 10 = 50

Key words tells the browser to create varibles.

Identifiers: name variables, key words and functions
Begin with a letter, $ or _ (not numbers): These can be followed by letters, digits, underscores or $$$
JS is case sensitive lastname, lastName, LastName
Dont use first-name because - is considered a minus. Use camel case firstName or _ -->
